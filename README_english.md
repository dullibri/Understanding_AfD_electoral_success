# Understanding_AfD_electoral_success
This project intends to shed some light on the recent electoral success of Germany's right wing party Alternative f√ºr Deutschland 
(Alternative for Germany, AfD) through an empirical approach. This should be done by:
1. Collect data on a regional (county or city level) 
2. Merge those data in one database
3. Merge with data on AfD's electoral success on a regional basis
4. Highlight an graphically analyze correlations 
5. Apply machine learning regression analysis to uncover the main drivers of AfD's success.

To start with, the code will be supplied in Python. However, the project is not limited to this software package.
